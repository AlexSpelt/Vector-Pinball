# Vector Pinball

Vector Pinball is a pinball game for Android devices.
It is released under version 3 of the GPL; see [COPYING](COPYING.txt) for the license text.

The graphics are deliberately simple; currently everything is drawn with lines and circles.
The focus is on gameplay and accurate physics.
It uses the libgdx Java wrapper for the Box2D physics engine.
Thanks to Peter Drescher for the sound effects; see [his article on creating them](http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2011/06/fmod-for-android.html).
